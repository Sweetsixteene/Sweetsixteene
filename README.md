## 💡 Philosophy

I enjoy programming, but I use it as a tool to solve real-life problems. Whenever I see something inconvenient—like the clunky Excel schedule my university used before my app—I’m motivated to build something better. I’m not coding for the sake of code, but to make life easier and more efficient for myself and those around me.
